South Asian Britain: Connected Histories is an interactive digital learning resource that offers an exciting insight into the long history of South Asians in Britain. Users can access histories of how South Asian people, events and organizations were networked and connected across the four nations of the UK, from the 1830s to the present.  South Asian Britain: Connecting Histories stems from the AHRC-funded project, â€˜Remaking Britain: South Asian Connections and Networks, 1830s-present', a collaboration between the University of Bristol, Queen Mary University of London and the British Library, and is developed in partnership with Research IT.

Research IT undertook the software development aspects of the project, generating the online database and producing software to carry out data management tasks.
